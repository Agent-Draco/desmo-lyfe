This project was scaffolded with Lovable.dev (Supabase/React/Tailwind/Shadcn).

Do NOT change the UI library; strictly stick to Shadcn/Tailwind.

We use Supabase for the backend.

Do not assume local environment; this is a PWA.

This project was further edited with BlackBox, KiloCode and Windsurf Cascade (SWE-1.5[Windsurf's In-house model] and ChatGPT Reasoning Low[OpenAI's GPT-5 using low reasoning and spending less tokens]).

Do not assume RLS (Row-Level Security) for the Supabase project as it can cause many errors. This project is the work of many AIs together so careful. Everything might be different styles mixed together.
